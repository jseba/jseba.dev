At Cboe, I was a software engineer on the core trading systems that operated
across three asset classes (U.S. Equities, Options and Futures). I was the
primary maintainer for the order entry gateway, as well as working on the order
routing system, handling the entry of orders to other exchanges. This was done
in a heavily regulated environment in which time was measured at the microsecond
level.

One of the major projects I was involved in was the migration of the Cboe
Futures Exchange (CFE) to a new technology platform. In 2017, Cboe acquired Bats
Global Markets and began migrating to Bats' technology platform. My role in the
project was to design and implement the extensions and changes to the existing
FIX (Financial Information eXchange) and BOE (Binary Order Entry) protocols to
support CFE on the Bats platform.

Another major project I worked on included the addition of Complex Options
orders to the existing BZX and EDGX Options exchanges. I worked to design and
implement the extensions to the FIX and BOE protocols to support the new order
types, as well as assisting with the process to get trading members certified to
send complex orders.

I also implemented order routing between the Cboe exchanges using the
proprietary BOE protocol instead of the FIX protocol. This reduced latencies for
the approximately 400 million daily messages by nearly 35% compared to FIX.
